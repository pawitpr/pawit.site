# What is?
TCP/UDP tunnel over HTTP is a networking technique that enables the encapsulation of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) traffic within HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests and responses. This method is used to bypass restrictions or firewalls that might block direct TCP/UDP connections and allows these protocols to traverse networks that primarily allow HTTP traffic.

## Prop and Crons
P.
+ Forward any portocol to http [Port Forwarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding) without NAT?ROUTER
  Easy to use no configuration required
  Forward Sock5

C.
+  Not Fast as UDP
   No connectionless
  

## How its work
![how](https://werblog.github.io/images/tunnel.png "a work")


## Set-up
Server which want 4040 tcp echo server
```bash
    go install github.com/jpillora/chisel@latest # Go 1.2+
    chisel server --port 8080 # Asume the ip address of server is 192.168.0.11 and server is running

```
Client which have 4040 TCP echo server

```bash

  chisel client https://192.168.0.11:8080 4040 ## Tunneling 4040 Localhost port to Server localhost:4040
```

I hope you will understand
